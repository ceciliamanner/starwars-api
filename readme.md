# Star Wars API - Assignment 1 

## Project Description
This assignment focuses on asynchronous JavaScript and dynamic data rendering.  
It uses the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.py4e.com/) to fetch and display data about **Star Wars films, characters, planets, and vehicles**, with a clean, responsive interface and interactive modal views.

The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, bundled with **Vite**. All data is dynamically loaded from the API and presented in one single HTML page.

## Installation


## Usage
When the site loads, it automatically displays a list of Star Wars films.
Users can click on any of the four category buttons in the navigation bar to load other data from the API (people, planets, or vehicles). Each record is presented in a card with a title and image.

Clicking on a card opens a modal showing additional details.
If an API request fails (e.g., no internet connection), a clear error message is shown to the user.

All content is dynamically rendered based on the selected category and fetched data.
